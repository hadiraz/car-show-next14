# Car Show Website ðŸš—ðŸ’»

Welcome to the Car Show Website! This project is a showcase website for cars built with Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Headless UI, and TypeScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to explore various cars along with filtering options.

## Features

- **Dynamic Filtering**: Users can filter cars based on various criteria such as make, model, year, etc.
- **API Integration**: The website fetches car data from an external API to populate its database and provide up-to-date information.
- **Responsive Design**: Built using Tailwind CSS, the website is fully responsive and works seamlessly across all devices.
- **Server Components**: Utilizes Next.js server components for dynamic server-side rendering.
- **Client Components**: Employs Next.js client components for efficient client-side rendering.

## Tech Stack

- **Next.js**: A React framework for building server-side rendered and statically generated web applications.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for building custom designs quickly.
- **Headless UI**: A set of unstyled, fully accessible UI components for developers building their own designs.
- **TypeScript**: A typed superset of JavaScript that enhances code quality and developer productivity.


## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
